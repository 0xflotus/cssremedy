# Changelog & Release Notes

## v0.1.0-beta.1 - 9/12/2019

This is an incomplete set of remedies,
and still very likely to change -
but you have to start somewhere.

- Move stylsheets into `css/` directory
- Organize the existing proposed & discussed remedies into three categories:
  - Universally recommended remedies in `remedy.css`
  - Optional remedies worth considering in `reminders.css`
  - Specialized remedies (such as `quotes.css`) in their own files
