## Pull Reguests

We're also happy to take pull requests,
both for fixing bugs/typos
and submitting new remedies.
For larger changes,
it's often best to file an issue for discussion first.

The code is organized into:

- A core `remedy.css` that we recommend using broadly across most projects.
- A secondary `reminders.css` with more opinionated or situational remedies that should be reviewed and considered on a case-by-case basis.
- Additional specialized remedy files (such as `quotes.css`) that can be used as-needed, but may not be required generally.

The `process` folder contains related materials:

- Other resets
- UA stylesheets from various browsers
- An html file to test against
