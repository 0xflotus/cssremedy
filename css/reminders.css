Reminders

These are not universally recommended remedies,

and they might work for you.

/* Nav Lists

/*
Nav Lists

List styling is not usually desired in navigation,
but this also removes list-semantics for screen-readers.
See: [issue #15 discussion](https://github.com/mozdevs/cssremedy/issues/15)

nav ul {
  list-style: none;

/*
Nav Items

1. Add zero-width-space to prevent VoiceOver disable
2. Absolute position ensures no extra space

See: ["VoiceOver and list-style-type: none"](https://unfetteredthoughts.net/2017/09/26/voiceover-and-list-style-type-none/)

/* Motion

Reduced Motion

1. Immediately jump any animation to the end point
2. Remove transitions & fixed background attachment

Line Heights

The default `normal` line-height is tightly spaced, but takes font-metrics into account.
Looser spacing may improve readability, but may cause problems in some scripts.
